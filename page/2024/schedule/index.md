We would love to see you all and get to spend some more time with you before the big day. There will be pizza, salad, lawn games and general merriment. This will most likely be an alcohol-free event due to venue bartender requirements. This will be hosted at our wedding venue.

The After Party

9:05pm - ???

Downtown San Luis Obispo

Unfortunately due to city quiet hours, we have to end the reception at 9:00pm, but the party doesn't have to stop there! If there's enough interest, we will arrange a fun-filled shuttle ride to downtown San Luis Obispo, where the nightlife is buzzing! The shuttle will whisk us away around 9:05pm, landing us in the heart of SLO around 9:35pm.

We expect keep the dancing going until midnight, but if we're slowing down after the big day we may head back a bit sooner. You are welcome to take the shuttle with us back to the venue, although the venue won't be open to guests at that time. Please note that it will be a casual gathering without a reserved space, and drinks will be available for purchase at the bar. We look forward to celebrating with you!

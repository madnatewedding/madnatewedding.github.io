## Gifts

The most important thing to us is that you are able to celebrate with us on our wedding day. We would also love and appreciate special or sentimental gifts that you'd like to give us on our special day. However if you'd like to help us celebrate and don't have something special in mind, we've set up a honeymoon fund and contributions would be greatly appreciated.

For anyone who wishes to give a gift via check, please make the checks out to Nathaniel Bramham. If you'd prefer to gift us digitally, please use the Venmo link below.

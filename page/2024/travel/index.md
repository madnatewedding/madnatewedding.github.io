## The Surrounding Cities

Within a 30 mile radius, there are a lot of hotel options in the surrounding cities. Here's a bit more information on each town to help you decide what makes sense for you.

## San Luis Obispo

San Luis Obispo (SLO) is the city with the most activities and food choices. There are many hotel options in the downtown area. It is also the city with the closest airport for any guests who are traveling long distances and prefer to fly. The downtown area is very walkable, however the town can get hot during the summer because it is more inland.

## Pismo Beach

Pismo Beach is right on the beach and will have some beautiful weather. There are a fair number of hotel options right on the beach with more options a bit further out. While there aren't many places you can walk within town, it's great for a beach day and only a 13 mile drive to downtown SLO.

## Santa Maria

Santa Maria is a bigger town with a few activities and will likely have the most affordable hotel options. The town tends to be very hot during the summers. While the area offers affordability, it can be less advisable to walk the town and we recommend taking more precautions if you do choose to stay here.

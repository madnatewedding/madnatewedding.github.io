## FAQs

Within a 30 mile radius, there are a lot of hotel options in the surrounding cities. Here's a bit more information on each town to help you decide what makes sense for you.

## Are kids invited?

Although we love to watch the children laugh and play, this is going to be an adults-only kind of day. We ask that all guests be over 16 years of age.

## Can I bring a date?

While we wish we could invite everyone to help us celebrate, we ask that only the people named on the invitation attend. Only those with additional guests listed on their invitation may bring a plus one.

## What's the dress code?

Our dress code for the evening is garden party chic, so think semi-formal with a slash of spring colors and floral patterns.

Please note, the wedding ceremony and reception will be on grass, so we recommend avoiding thin heels or shoes that may be difficult to walk in. Also, the weather in Nipomo can get chilly and windy in the evenings so we recommend bringing a jacket.

Not sure what to wear? No worries! We've got a handy link with all the details and some stylish inspo: [https://greenweddingshoes.com/garden-party-attire-dress-code/](https://greenweddingshoes.com/garden-party-attire-dress-code/)

## Is there a hotel block?

The bride, groom, and immediate family will be staying at the on-site accommodations at the wedding venue. Due to the inn's very limited capacity we aren't able to offer any hotel blocks for the special day but there are plenty of available options within a short distance from the venue.

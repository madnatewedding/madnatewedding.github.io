Madeline  
& Nathaniel

5 . 25 . 25

## How we met

2014

In our first year of college, we both had met this really cool guy named Evan. Madeline was in art class with Evan. Nate was his roommate. One night a group from the art class was working on a project and they had all decided to meet in Evan's dorm room to work. While Madeline sat there working on the project, Nate walked in and decided to join us and hang out. I thought he was cute. He thought I was cute. We became close friends during our time there.

After college, Nate moved to Seattle for a year and he became Madeline's "one that got away." Then one day Madeline got a text, Nate was moving back to Santa Barbara. A few months later he was no longer the one that got away.

## The Proposal

12 . 17 . 23

Our proposal ended up being much more of an adventure than we could have anticipated. Nate had plans to propose and had coordinated everything with our friends. All was ready to go and then when the morning came he woke up feeling really sick. As the day went on he gradually felt worse and realized he had to call off all his plans. Things got so bad we ended up taking him to the emergency room, where he stayed for 3 days recovering. Afterwards he regrouped, and got everything coordinated again.
